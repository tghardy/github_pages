When I’m done with this year of school, I hope to transition to being an integrated BS/MS student in Statistics at BYU. I love exploring what data means and the stories it tells.\nPreviously, I worked for BYU Sports Camps as their Head Counselor. During my time, I did several data projects:\n\nI designed an algorithm to automate selection of camp registrants that would be admitted this year.\nI used Power BI to analyze market research, making 14 different dashboards for the camp administrators to more easily access feedback from camp participants.\nI created reports in Qualtrics to help head coaches to know how to improve their camps.\n\nI am currently researching RAG methods and techniques, and developing open-source software to improve the use of LLMs in education and the workplace."

    "text": "The mlbplotR Package\nAs part of the Sports Dataverse, we can use the mlbplotR package to easily put logos on an existing ggplot. This means it’s as simple as adding just one more line to the code you’ve already written!\nTo start out, you can use the function load_mlb_teams() to pull team names and basic info, or you can pull your data from a sports data website. I recommend just pulling data from baseball-reference.com or a similar website, and this should come with team names already. If you want to follow along with my code, the data I used is on my GitHub.\nI’ve decided that I want to create a graph of ERA+ and OPS+ for each team in the 2025 season. These are metrics that show how a team’s performance has been relative to the rest of the league, so it should be a fairly interesting graph."

If you don’t have them, use the install.packages() function.\nlibrary(mlbplotR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nAs I mentioned before, I’ll be using pitching and batting data from Baseball Reference. They have a nice feature that lets you design and filter your own tables, so I would definitely recommend using them. I downloaded CSV files and put them in my working directory.\n# Make sure you're bringing in the right number of rows!\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"batting.csv\", n_max = 31)\nbatting &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\", n_max = 31)\n\n\nWrangling\nWhen I downloaded the data from Baseball Reference, I made sure to only keep the columns I was interested in (ERA+ and OPS+). This means that the wrangling I need to do in R is minimal.\nThe main things we need to do are:\n\nMake sure all of our data is in the same table\nMake sure our team abbreviations are correct\n\nmlbplotR requires that your dataset includes the Baseball Savant team abbreviations to properly show each logo. If you don’t know these, don’t worry- you can just copy the vector I have below. Or, if your data already has team abbreviations, you can use the function clean_team_abbrs() to make sure they’re correct.\nSince my data was pretty simple and on two tables, I only need to run a simple join to get my data all together.\ncombined &lt;- pitching |&gt; \n    full_join(batting, by = join_by(\"Tm\"))\n\ncombined$abbr &lt;- c(\"AZ\", \"ATH\", \"ATL\", \"BAL\", \"BOS\", \"CHC\", \"CWS\", \"CIN\", \"CLE\", \"COL\", \"DET\", \"HOU\", \"KC\", \"LAA\", \"LAD\", \n                   \"MIA\", \"MIL\", \"MIN\", \"NYM\", \"NYY\", \"PHI\", \"PIT\", \"SD\", \"SEA\", \"SF\", \"STL\", \"TB\", \"TEX\", \"TOR\", \"WSH\")\n\n\n# If you aren't sure your abbreviations are correct, you can use the following function: \n# clean_team_abbrs(combined$abbr, keep_non_matches = FALSE) \n\n\nVisualization\nNow is the best part! First I’ll show my code block, then I’ll break it down line by line.\ncombined |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = `OPS+`, y = `ERA+`)) +\n    geom_mlb_logos(aes(team_abbr = abbr, width = 0.055)) +\n    theme_bw() +\n    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(78, 122)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(78, 122)) +\n    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 100), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 100), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n    labs(x = \"OPS+\",\n         y = \"ERA+\",\n         title = \"Pitching and Batting Performance for MLB Teams (2025)\",\n         caption = \"Source: Baseball-Reference.com\")\n\nggsave(\"plot1.png\")\n\nggplot(aes(x = `OPS+`, y = `ERA+`)) - Sets my x and y axis elements\ngeom_mlb_logos(aes(team_abbr = abbr, width = 0.055)) - Adds team logos to the plot as if it were a scatterplot. team_abbr = abbr tells the function where my team abbreviations are stored, and the width argument makes the logos much smaller than their original images.\ntheme_bw() - Good looking, professional theme\nscale_x_continuous(limits = c(78, 122)) - Sets the x scale to a more appropriate level. I like to keep it square and centered on my data.\ngeom_hline and geom_vline are helpful to visualize where the league average is. For the stats I chose, the league average is 100, but you can use mean() to find it for other variables.\n\nAnd here’s the finished product:\n\n\n\nPitching and Batting Performance for MLB Teams (2025)"

Even though it may seem daunting at first, it’s just as simple as prepping your data well and adding geom_mlb_logos() to an already existing ggplot object.\nNow that you know how to make an interesting viz like this, why not go make your own? Tons of data can be found on Baseball Reference and Fangraphs, or maybe you can learn how to pull your own data using the baseballR package. Happy plotting!"
